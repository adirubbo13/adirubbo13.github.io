						<p>I am currently a graduate student at Syracuse University studying and practicing in the expanding world of computer and data science. I am interested in database development, web development, advanced data analysis, as well as business-to-business software development. I am currently exploring the many pathways of analytics as they cross into areas of study such as healthcare, advertising, and finance. I am also interested in both front-end and back-end web design.</p>
						<p>I completed my undergrad at St. John Fisher University, where I was on the track and cross-country teams, as well as a peer math tutor for various statistics and computer science courses. Throughout my education at St. John Fisher, I have had the privilege of working with clients to produce work in a professional-like setting.</p>
						<p>This portfolio highlights various assignments I have completed to demonstrate my proficiency in many computer science topics. It is a living testament to my ability to embrace and master a multitude of languages and frameworks. Whether it's crafting responsive and intuitive user interfaces with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, or delving into the intricacies of backend development using Python or Java, I thrive on the challenge of creating robust and scalable solutions.</p>
